# Backgammon-Game-With-Chat
A web-based backgammon game that includes a chat feature. It was developed using React for the frontend, microservices written in C# using ASP.NET, and MongoDB as the database. The chat functionality was implemented using SignalR.

The project follows Clean Architecture principles, which means that the code is organized into layers that are independent of each other. This makes the code more maintainable, testable, and scalable.
